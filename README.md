# Movie Recommender System
Recommender systems are an important class of machine learning algorithms that offer “relevant” suggestions to users.
Movie Recommender System is a content based recommender system. Source of dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata.

Built machine learning algorithm would recommend movies based on a movie the user likes. This Machine Learning model would be based on Cosine Similarity.
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar two items are. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The output value ranges from 0–1.

0 means no similarity, where as 1 means that both the items are 100% similar.
